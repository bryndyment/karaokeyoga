We spend our lives campaigning for these animals and their welfare so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uplifting to hear so many of you care about them as we do. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make changes every day to lift up awareness and draw down carbon so that we can move forward together and create a world we all can live in safely and peacefully. Thank you. #turningthetide.",
