        "share_text": "This Muriel Spark book was missing the last page of text, left unintentionally blank. We found the ending online and filled it in. Emma did it because their handwriting is better than mine. This is NOT the first time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found this book with a blank last page, which means at some point the publisher saw it and went \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood enough, the readers can figure out the ending on their own- SHIP IT!\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Overall, really enjoyed this book! another fantastic comedy of manners from the always delightful Spark, who towards the end of her life was still funny and weird and churning out biting, obscure references that make 150 page books whiz by in minutes and have you immediately reaching for another. Great to finally know how it all ends!\n.\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u0096 #books #bookstagram #murielspark #aidingandabetting",
