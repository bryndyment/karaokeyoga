        "share_text": "The baddest man on the planet is undoubtedly Iron Mike Tyson: 5'10\" & 230lbs of malicious intentions expressed via the majesty of hooks & uppercuts. Sharing the dimensions of Bill Pearl for most of his life has paid dividends for the world's favorite boxer, who's still that size at 58 & looking to add another win to his 50W-6L-2NC (44KO) record this evening against @jakepaul.\n\nTyson has a borderline psychotic devotion to maintaining the exact physique of his youth, & his fighting weight has only increased 14lbs in the 38 years of his professional fighting career. He weighed 221lbs when he became the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title & only weighs 7lbs more as he approaches 60.\n\nDiligence, persistence, & consistency are the reasons why Mike Tyson is who he is, & that's reflected in the fact that he looks the same at 58 that he did at 28. Tyson is well known for having built most of his Luke Cage-esque build with calisthenics, under the direction of Cus D'Amto, who didn't like his boxers to lift because he believed it reduced their hand speed. Lifters of the 19th century knew that you only needed to start adding weights to your program if you wanted to get your arms bigger than a 16\" cold- rope climbing, calisthenics, & fight sports would be fine otherwise. The following is his routine under Cus D'Amato, which had him fighting at 214lbs & rocking 16\" cold-measured arms.\n \n4AM- Lots of stretching followed by 10 interval sprints & 10 box jumps.\n430AM- 3-4 mile run followed by a mile-long walk.\n530AM- Shower & nap\n10AM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Oatmeal & milk for breakfast\n12PM- 45-60 mins of Skills & ring work followed by 10 rounds of sparring\n2PM- Chicken & rice or steak & pasta with fruit juice for lunch\n3PM- 45-60mins skills & ring work followed by 60 min on exercise bike.\n5PM- 2000 squats, 2500 sit ups, 500-800 dips, 500 push ups, 500 shrugs w/ 65lb barbell, & 10 mins of neck work (bridges, headstands, etc)\n7PM- Dinner is same as lunch\n830PM- another 30-45 mins on the bike.\n930PM- Bed\n\nBang that link in my profile & use the old school methods natty builders like Bob Higgins (133lbs, 17\" arms) used to grow from 16\" cold to 17\", 18\", & 19\"+ w/ Huge Natty Arms!",

As a result, all the text is in English. There are a total of nine volumes, but due to their extreme rarity, I have only had the opportunity to see two of them. This particular one is the inaugural issue launched in 1951.\n\nThe beautiful layout of the products and the advertising designs by various companies showcase Katsue Kitasono's little-known yet remarkable work as a designer who inherited the design principles of Bauhaus, despite being a poet.",
