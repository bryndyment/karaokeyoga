Our friend from #NY, photographer #joshcheuse, was friends with #mickjones from #theclash . He worked with them a little bit and hooked it up for us to go hang out with him one night. AT HIS FUCKIN\u00e2\u0080\u0099 HOUSE! \n\nAnd by the way, he is one of the nicest people in the world. We meet, hang out, have a little tea, a couple beers, and then he shows us his studio in the basement. Not a practice space, but a nice little studio, with all kinds of equipment. While Mick Jones is showing us a guitar of his, Yauch asks him to play Clash City Rockers. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what possessed him to do that but, I mean, fuck yeah, I wanted that to happen. He kind of laughed and said that he forgot how to play it, and so Yauch took the guitar and taught Mick Jones how to play the song. Yes! Mick Jones from the fucking Clash. \n\nOh wait\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the door. Yup. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Joe fucking Strummer! Our new close friend Mick Jones had said some people were coming over; Now #joestrummer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s here & the doorbell rings again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fucking Johnny fucking Rotten! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with this cool-ass German lady and we are now officially drunk, and freaking out. In Mick Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living room. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting ready to go see a movie, and one more person shows up on our way out. Take a guess\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 could be any-fuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099-body, right? It is one of the coolest people in the world. Ever. #paulsimonon.\n\nPicture yourself with your two best friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 real tipsy. Driving around the streets of London at night with, basically, the fucking Clash & #johnnyrotten. Stopping at red lights, laughing, screaming, and throwing things at each other out the windows. I mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just a few years ago, these people made music that changed our lives\".",

This change of perspective reveals to us a hidden world or culture even. Passengers are laid out in the back of each truck, surrounded by their various possessions. Tight cropping excludes everything around the truck except a small section of the road, emphasizing the frame-like quality, presenting us the contents as tableaux, in belief-defying sharpness. A quality which, though it casts some doubt as to the actual spontaneity and verisimilitude of the images, certainly lends to the idea of the image as a painting. Each person or grouping is so still, so perfectly composed that these confined spaces take on an almost religious significance, resembling the grave good arrangements found on prehistoric burial sites. This religious aspect is emphasized by the sporadic addition of images of the sky over their heads.
