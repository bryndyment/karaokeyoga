        "share_text": "Screen legend Buster Keaton sitting at a bar in Culver City in 1955, looking like a hardened detective from the greatest film noir never made. \n\nIn actuality, this bar was built on a soundstage at Hal Roach Studios for the filming of an episode of NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Screen Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Playhouse titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Silent Partner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which Keaton plays a forgotten silent film star made to reflect on his career when a former co-star (played by Joe E. Brown) wins an Academy Award and thanks him in his speech. As Keaton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character watches this from a crowded bar, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s further confronted with his past when the television then plays the fictional film that they once made together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and this is the real point of the episode, as this framing device sets them up to debut a new silent two-reel comedy with Keaton, Brown, and ZaSu Pitts, more than 25 years after film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition to sound. The episode was directed by George Marshall, whose own career started in the silent era, directing the westerns of Harry Carey, and later Tom Mix, and a number of Laurel & Hardy films as well.\n\nThis was made at a time when Keaton was experiencing something of a revival thanks to the rise of television, which created a renewed interest in silent cinema in the early 1950s. Then, through an incredible stroke of dumb luck, a trove of Keaton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old film reels were discovered by English actor James Mason, who had purchased Keaton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old house in 1952. Mason reportedly arranged to have the decomposing films transferred to Cellulose acetate film (\u00e2\u0080\u009csafety film\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for preservation, and had them delivered the collection to Keaton, who then entered discussions with a film distributor to get them back into theaters.\n\nThe Screen Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Playhouse was just one of more than 70 guest appearances that Keaton made on television over the course of the next decade, and he returned to the big screen more than a dozen times with cameo roles up through the end of his life. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nPhoto by Loomis Dean for LIFE Magazine",
