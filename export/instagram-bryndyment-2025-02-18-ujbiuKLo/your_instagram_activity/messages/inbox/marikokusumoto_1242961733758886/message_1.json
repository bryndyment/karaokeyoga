I'm little bit sad that if we move to Japan, I won't be able to see her often anymore, so this is a big decision I have to make. I love going to abroad like you. Even we settle down in Japan, I'm planning to go to different county and have exhibitions. I probably will create things until the day I die. That's my dream! Anyway Take care and keep in touch! Thank you so much again for contacting me.",

My husband Glenn look forward to retiring in Japan. I'm sorry to hear that you are not with Akane anymore. I lost contact with her. Does she have Instagram account?                                                                          Anyway, thank you so much for remembering my old metal pieces. Unfortunately all my metal pieces were already sold. I probably go back to metal when I get tire of fabric. Anyway, It's so nice to hear from you. Keep in touch and I hope we will see you in Japan in the future if you are still there!",
