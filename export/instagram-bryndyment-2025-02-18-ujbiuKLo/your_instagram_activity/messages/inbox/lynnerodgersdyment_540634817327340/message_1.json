        "share_text": "I was sad to learn of my friend Marilyn Tuttle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passing two nights ago. She was 99 years old.\n\nMarilyn led an extraordinary life, in and out of show business. She began singing with Stan Kenton in 1944, then met Western singer Wesley Tuttle (one of the very first artists signed to Capitol Records, right after World War 2). Wesley and Marilyn were also original cast members of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Town Hall Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099 television show.\n\nDuring Wesley and Marilyn Tuttle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time in show business, they rubbed elbows with just about anyone you can think of. Marilyn had stories about everybody. \n\nLater in the 1950s, Wesley Tuttle abandoned traditional show business and became a preacher and gospel musician. Marilyn followed suit. When Johnny Cash moved to the West Coast for several years in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Wesley Tuttle became Johnny Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiritual advisor. Marilyn recalled many times where Cash, reeling from some new egregious offense he had just committed, would go find Wesley at their religious book store/recording studio in San Fernando to confess, talk things through, and seek forgiveness.\n\nWesley Tuttle died in 2003, and Marilyn remained active, especially in the Western Music scene in California. \n\nIn 2023, Keenan Wade and Grace Adele, known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Farmer and Adele,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visited Los Angeles, and I set up a meeting for them to meet Marilyn at the Autry Museum, facilitated by mutual pal Sage Guyton of the Lucky Stars. It was such a wonderful day. Keenan and Grace and Marilyn began singing beautiful three-part Western harmonies. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never forget that magical sound that happened when Marilyn added that third high-part harmony. It was a sound that time-traveled all of us back to the 1940s. It was a great day.\n\n99 years is a damn good run, and we should all be grateful for the years that we got to spend around Marilyn. She was a beautiful woman, inside and out. I hope that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reunited with Wesley today, and there are beautiful Western harmonies in heaven. My condolences go out to all her family. Happy Trails to you, Marilyn.",

        "share_text": "The Arcane Texas Fact of the Day is a little passel of facts about Buddy Holly: \n\n1) The very first song recorded by the band that would become known as The Beatles was by Texan Buddy Holly. In 1958, The Quarrymen --- John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Colin Hanton on drums and John \"Duff\" Lowe, on piano ---- recorded \"That'll Be the Day.\" \n\n2) Similarly, one of the very first songs recorded by the Rolling Stones was Buddy's \"Not Fade Away.\" \n\n3)  Buddy Holly once handmade a leather wallet for Marty Robbins. Robbins' manager was so impressed he asked Buddy if he could order 300 more. Buddy, of course, had no time for that. \n\n4) I'd always known that Buddy was a huge Elvis fan and would go and see Elvis perform when Elvis played in Lubbock. What I didn't know was that Buddy, who was relentlessly ambitious, made a point of befriending Elvis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeeting Elvis was what really inspired Buddy to get things going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bob Montgomery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come through, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d talk to him. We saw Gentle\u00c2\u00admen Prefer Blondes with him one after\u00c2\u00adnoon at the theater and Elvis got bored af\u00c2\u00adter thirty minutes and we left with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bob Montgomery was a songwriting partner and best friend of Buddy Holly, performing with Buddy as the duo \"Buddy and Bob\" while teenagers in high school.  Initially, they played a variety of bluegrass music, which evolved into rockabilly sounds.\n\n5)  Between February 1957 and April 1958, 14 months, Buddy recorded \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll Be the Day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot Fade Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeggy Sue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Boy!,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRave On,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All Right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s So Easy (to fall in love). Every one of them is a timeless classic.\n\nShown here: Buddy Holly without his glasses in 1957.",

        "share_text": "From the 1920s through the 1960s, neon signs blazed all over San Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0094nearly the entire length of Market Street and much of Broadway\u00e2\u0080\u0094with displays that became ever more elaborate as businesses tried to compete for attention with their radiant fixtures. But starting in the 1970s, affordable, easy-to-maintain light-emitting diodes (LEDs) came into popular use, leading to neon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decline. \n\nLuckily, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing movement, spearheaded by organizations like the advocacy group San Francisco Neon and supported by businesses like Neon Works, not only to protect our city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing neon but also to add to its glowing portfolio. One of the best ways to ensure neon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survival, according to San Francisco Neon co-founder Randall Ann Homan, is to patronize the businesses that take the trouble of maintaining the signs.\n\nYou have plenty to choose from in the city: grocery stores and steakhouses, cocktail bars and movie theaters. So use neon as an excuse to get out and explore those new-to-you corners of the city and tap the link in our bio for some more photos of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most spectacular neon signs.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b8: @jasonhenry\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u009d: Julie Zigoris\n\n#SFStandard #SanFrancisco #BayArea #News #LocalNews #Neon #NeonWorks",

I do not think promoting this behavior is a good idea because I can totally see it getting someone (or more likely a lot of bears) killed one day. \n\nI ultimately decided to use the virality of this video in an attempt to innoculate against future occurrences, in the hope that if presented with a choice like this, you'll choose the path that doesn't involve putting your body within striking distance of a momma bear with vulnerable cubs. Ever. \n\nSo first off, let me go ahead and state unequivocally that you should never ever ever approach any wild animal, especially those with offspring, unless all other options have been exhausted.\n\nOn the flip side, I also understand the impulse to save your pets. In this case, it worked out the best way possible (for the human at least) but she was soo damn lucky to get out of there in one piece. \n\nProtective instincts are on full display in this one, and I truly believe that the bear's fixation on the dogs allowed the woman to get close enough to tip the scales in her favor long enough to get the dogs and herself out of harms way.\n\nJust keep in mind that this could have ended very differently, so please don't try this.\n\n#natureismetal\n#keepnaturemetal \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nHit the link in our bio to browse our store! \n\nUse NIM10 at checkout!",
