        "share_text": "The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band formed at McCabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Record Store in Long Beach in 1966 with a lineup that briefly included Jackson Browne before he made his name as a solo star. By 1967 they were in LA, hoping to make it big while living in a shared house in Beachwood Canyon, which was dubbed by the band and local musicians alike as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Dirt House.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0\nNewly signed to Liberty Records and playing regular gigs at the Ash Grove (now the Improv on Melrose Ave,) the band recorded their first album at Steiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eight Track studio, home of Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 8-track machine. In his autobiography, banjo player John McEuen recalled hearing their first hit single on radio station KRLA in 1967. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was driving down Sunset Boulevard coming up to Vine Street with the radio on loud as I flipped through the\u00c2\u00a0stations. One of our songs, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy for Me the Rain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McEuen remembers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt 1:03am the jock said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new song by that Nitty Gritty Dirt Band!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0I almost drove off the road! I went to the All Night Ranch Market,\u00c2\u00a0spent all twelve dollars I had on food, took it back to the Dirt House, and told\u00c2\u00a0everyone \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna be rich! I just heard \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rain\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on KRLA!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0\nOn the strength of their first single the group hit the road for a short promotional tour of the East Coast where they met another up-and-coming band in St Louis called the Allman Joys and suggested they return with them to LA. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother and I went down to see them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they were great. Bill convinced them to come to L.A. and give him a shot at managing them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McEuen said in a later interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey came out and lived with the Dirt Band for the first five months. The Dirt Band had a house. It was a hippie crash pad of the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s because it was full of musicians and a couple of road guys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTomorrow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share a Flash Back Friday post about Gregg Allman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time in Laurel Canyon after he moved out of the Dirt House and into a girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place where he had a hilarious run in with The Doors!\n\nJohn McEuen was also friends with another Laurel Canyon neigbour, Steve Martin who he met when they were both teens working at Disneyland magic shops. Martin became McEuen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first banjo student and life-long friend. \n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b7 Getty Images",

He had two dozen Top 20 hits in the Billboard country charts between 1953 and 1975; his versatility and matinee-idol looks propelling a seven-decade entertainment career.\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Husky's hits included \"Gone\" and \"Wings of a Dove\", each reaching No. 1 on the country charts. He also created a comic outspoken hayseed character, Simon Crum; and recorded under the stage name Terry Preston from 1948 to 1953.\nIn 2010, Husky was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.(Wiki) \n\n#ferlinhusky\u00c2\u00a0#countrymusic #country #classiccountry #gospelmusic #dimestoreradio",

        "share_text": "\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00a0From windswept dunes to rows of homes, the Sunset District redefined itself between the 1920s and 1940s. The transformation was in large part undertaken by Henry Doelger, a local developer with a goal to make homeownership accessible to working-class families. The blocks encompassing 27th \u00e2\u0080\u0093 39th Avenues between Kirkham and Quintara Streets earned the nickname \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoelger City.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Working out of a sales office at 320 Judah Street, Doelger Building Inc went on to build over 16,000 homes in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s west side. Over the years, 6 different styles of Doelger Homes came to be recognized in the Sunset District. Watch closely and take note of these \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle boxes on the hillside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n1\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3Mediterranean Revival: The first Doelger home was built in 1927 at 1427 39th Avenue. Themes of this style include open stairwells, stucco exterior, decorations on facade and a barrel front hanging over the garage.\n2\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3The Styleocrat: Building trends in the 1940s shifted to the Streamline Moderne style. These homes are sleek, include a tunneled entrance and lack ornamental design. Stained-glass box windows and lines are also noticeable features of the exterior. \n3\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3Rainbow House: This model is color-styled with small balconies unlike its predecessor. Still, many streamlined features are present such as a concealed stairway. \n4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3The Freedom House:The construction of Doelger homes continued during WW2 despite constraints on materials. Houses were smaller and cheaper than previous models. Notice the semi-sheltered stairway, compact garage and triangular (pitched) roof. \n5\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3The Nantucket: With building materials diverted to war efforts, the practice of simplified design elements continued with these homes. Being taller than other styles gives it a commanding presence in the Avenues as well as larger living space.\n6\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3The Westridge: Doelger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last style, the colonial-styled homes were designed for Veterans returning back to SF. Doelger ensured his homes were in reach for GIs using VA loans. The exterior features shutters and wood-like finish.",

        "share_text": "The Arcane Texas Fact of the Day is a little passel of facts about Buddy Holly: \n\n1) The very first song recorded by the band that would become known as The Beatles was by Texan Buddy Holly. In 1958, The Quarrymen --- John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Colin Hanton on drums and John \"Duff\" Lowe, on piano ---- recorded \"That'll Be the Day.\" \n\n2) Similarly, one of the very first songs recorded by the Rolling Stones was Buddy's \"Not Fade Away.\" \n\n3)  Buddy Holly once handmade a leather wallet for Marty Robbins. Robbins' manager was so impressed he asked Buddy if he could order 300 more. Buddy, of course, had no time for that. \n\n4) I'd always known that Buddy was a huge Elvis fan and would go and see Elvis perform when Elvis played in Lubbock. What I didn't know was that Buddy, who was relentlessly ambitious, made a point of befriending Elvis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeeting Elvis was what really inspired Buddy to get things going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bob Montgomery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come through, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d talk to him. We saw Gentle\u00c2\u00admen Prefer Blondes with him one after\u00c2\u00adnoon at the theater and Elvis got bored af\u00c2\u00adter thirty minutes and we left with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bob Montgomery was a songwriting partner and best friend of Buddy Holly, performing with Buddy as the duo \"Buddy and Bob\" while teenagers in high school.  Initially, they played a variety of bluegrass music, which evolved into rockabilly sounds.\n\n5)  Between February 1957 and April 1958, 14 months, Buddy recorded \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll Be the Day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot Fade Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeggy Sue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Boy!,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRave On,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All Right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s So Easy (to fall in love).

In an article for the New Yorker in 2012, Sacks describes beginning his exploration when a friend offered him a joint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took two puffs and was transfixed by what happened then. I gazed at my hand, and it seemed to fill my visual field, getting larger and larger\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 stretched across the universe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sacks writes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy first pot experience was marked by a mixture of the neurological and the divine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom there Sacks moved on to LSD and morning-glory seeds, which were readily available in Topanga, before a friend suggested he try Artane, a synthetic drug that Sacks knew was used in the treatment of Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, one Sunday morning I counted out twenty pills\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and sat down to await the effect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recounts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould the world be transformed, newborn, as Huxley described in \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Doors of Perception,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and as I myself had experienced with mescaline and LSD?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead Sacks experienced intense hallucinations that included making eggs for friends who turned out to not be there, a helicopter dropping his parents off in his backyard and a casual conversation with a spider.\n\nAfter Sacks left Topanga for New York, his experimentation with drugs continued, this time with large doses of amphetamines. While working in a migraine clinic, he found a book on the subject that he began to read while high. Experiencing intense hallucinations that made him feel as though he was inside the body of the author, Sacks realized this field of study was where his attentions should turn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBit by bit, I started to write my own book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sacks writes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe joy I got from this was real - infinitely more substantial than the vapid mania of amphetamines - and I never took amphetamines again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b7 Unknown\n\n#oliversacks",

        "share_text": "All hail the great Cosimo Matassa, the genius who recorded 98% of the music of New Orleans from the late 1940s through the late 1960s.  This guy made your favorite records by Fats Domino, Little Richard, Smiley Lewis, Lee Dorsey, Dr. John, Aaron Neville, Art Neville, Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, Shirley and Lee, Frankie Ford, and about a thousand others.  The sound he got was THE coolest sound, like a party was going off in your living room, and he did it without a great deal of equipment.  This mid-1950s shot shows him with a tiny 4-channel Dukane mixer, a Cinema EQ unit, and not much else.  No air conditioning back then, so you know it was a thousand degrees in there, hence the t-shirt.\n\nIn later years, Cosimo managed the family grocery in the French Quarter.  One morning around 1999 or 2000, I walked over there after a gig in New Orleans the night before and asked if I could meet Cosimo.  A few minutes later, he came out of the back, a stout little Yoda of a man, and dutifully answered my questions for 15 minutes.\n\nHe wanted no credit for his role in creating some of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most iconic Rhythm and Blues, Rock \u00e2\u0080\u0098n\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Roll, Soul and Funk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was all about THOSE musicians.  Anybody could have put a few microphones in front of those guys and it would have sounded good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite his protestations to the contrary, no one has ever made records like THAT ever again.  He captured lightning in a bottle.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really glad I got to meet him. Cosimo Matassa, 1926-2014",

        "share_text": "From the 1920s through the 1960s, neon signs blazed all over San Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0094nearly the entire length of Market Street and much of Broadway\u00e2\u0080\u0094with displays that became ever more elaborate as businesses tried to compete for attention with their radiant fixtures. But starting in the 1970s, affordable, easy-to-maintain light-emitting diodes (LEDs) came into popular use, leading to neon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decline. \n\nLuckily, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing movement, spearheaded by organizations like the advocacy group San Francisco Neon and supported by businesses like Neon Works, not only to protect our city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing neon but also to add to its glowing portfolio. One of the best ways to ensure neon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survival, according to San Francisco Neon co-founder Randall Ann Homan, is to patronize the businesses that take the trouble of maintaining the signs.\n\nYou have plenty to choose from in the city: grocery stores and steakhouses, cocktail bars and movie theaters. So use neon as an excuse to get out and explore those new-to-you corners of the city and tap the link in our bio for some more photos of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most spectacular neon signs.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b8: @jasonhenry\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u009d: Julie Zigoris\n\n#SFStandard #SanFrancisco #BayArea #News #LocalNews #Neon #NeonWorks",

        "share_text": "A belated happy 100th birthday to the Vista Theatre, which first opened as Bard's Hollywood Theatre on October 9th, 1923.\n\nIntended as both a cinema and a vaudeville theatre, the Hollywood Bard was built by downtown theatre proprietor Lou Bard who'd had great success with his College and Hill Street theatres and was looking to expand. Setting his sights on Hollywood, Bard bought up a plot of land at Hollywood & Sunset that had once been part of the backlot for director D. W. Griffith's Reliance-Majestic Film Studios - in fact, it now stands approximately where the towering set of Babylon had been built for the 1916 film \"Intolerance\" (the studio itself was located where the Vons now stands across the street). Bard then brought in architect Lewis A. Smith, who designed it with a Spanish Colonial Revival exterior, and an Egyptian Revival interior, inspired both by the success of Grauman's Egyptian Theatre and the world's fascination with the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb in 1922.\n\nWhen the theatre opened, 100 years ago yesterday, the opening night program consisted of the premiere of the Baby Peggy comedy short \"Tips,\" filmed nearby at the then-new Ambassador Hotel, followed by a sneak peek of the Universal comedy-drama \"The Wild Party,\" starring Gladys Walton. Vaudeville performances and other shorts also peppered the evening, which was reported as \"a fine entertainment for all, and altogether too much for one evening.\" This first photo was taken that night.\n\nThe theatre became the Vista in 1933 and operated through the 1950s, then it became an arthouse theatre in 1960, and then as a porno theatre in 1961. In 1980, the Vista re-opened as a mainstream cinema, but closed in 2020 due to COVID. \n\nIt was purchased by Quentin Tarantino in June of 2021, and is undergoing renovations, hopefully to re-open soon.\n\nPhotos: \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 2. \u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b7: Herman Schultheis, 1938\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 3.

Chris from @pfbvan and Kim from @thepaperhound were both interviewed about me and were incredibly kind and generous. I consider myself lucky to call them not just my colleagues, but also friends and mentors to myself and Calen. The wave of well-wishes we received from this article was so overwhelming to me that I had to put my phone down for a couple of days, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still playing a bit of catch up on messages (as you can see it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken me some time even to post this). It really proves to me that we fill a niche for a local bookshop here in Gibsons, as well as my own limitations for how much time I can spend gratefully answering messages before I need a break to recharge myself. I have to accept from this info that I may never be Heather from Chapters/Indigo, but I can still be important in the place where I stand. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had so many new faces in, and so many proud regulars congratulating us on the publicity. Thank you so much for all the kind words. All press is good press, I hear, but surely something like this is very good indeed. It certainly feels like it.\n.\nPS thank you so much to @folkfotos for the awesome pics of the store!",

His \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong Blonde Hair\u00e2\u0080\u009d still stands as one of the most goosebumps-inducing rockabilly singles of the 1950s. Johnny was one of the first original 1950s artists I ever saw, he came out to Southern California shortly after I moved there in 1991, backed by Big Sandy and the Fly-Rite Trio with T.K. Smith on guitar. Man, we were all 30 years younger then, including Johnny, and I remember Johnny and the Fly-Rites just tearing the roof off the joint, 3 or 4 nights in a row. Such a great memory. Johnny was pretty loyal to his Detroit bands over the years, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a lot of chances to back him up, but I did back him up at least twice, what a thrill! Also, I will mention his other claim to fame\u00e2\u0080\u0094 he was a fixture in the early years of Motown, and he had a great story about those stomping feet with tons of reverb that you hear at the beginning of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere Did Our Love Go\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the Supremes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Johnny, up in the Motown echo chamber, stomping his feet as hard as he could. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard that record a million times, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear it differently now, I promise! RIP Johnny, you left behind a lot of great music and memories.",

        "share_text": "Today, Ramblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Jack Elliott turns 90 years old. The late, great Johnny Cash once said that Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot a song and a friend for every mile behind him\u00e2\u0080\u009d and (despite Johnny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s propensity for tall tales) I believe it through and through. Student of Guthrie, father of Bob Dylan (or so he has been known to say), the Brooklyn cowboy, sailor of highways and rider of seas has made a lifetime of ramblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, gamblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and singing his songs.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nJust about every folk and country music star of the past 75 years has broken bread, shared a bottle of Cutty Sark with, or crossed paths with the inimitable Mr. Jack Elliott. In the recent past, our friend (and one of my favorite pen pals) @joshokeefeofficial shared a stage, some songs, and a swig or two of Guinness with the man who Woody Guthrie said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csounds more like me than I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josh was kind enough to send me a sketch he had done of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCowboy Jack, lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 young\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it is one of my favorite pieces of art in my collection, on account of Josh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generosity and talent, but also because of the significance of Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence on the world of North American folk music I love.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur clip this week was selected from the 1965 episode of Pete Seeger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rainbow Quest featuring Ramblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Jack. The song is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sailor Blues\u00e2\u0080\u009d a rendition of Woody Guthrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sailor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nearly 10 years earlier, in 1956, Jack released \u00e2\u0080\u009cWoody Guthrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a collection of songs penned by Guthrie and recorded in Ewan MacColl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living room by Alan Lomax. It is a gem of a song and a treasure trove of an album. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWoody Guthrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blues\u00e2\u0080\u009d was released in 1963 as, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Woody Guthrie\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a variant track arrangement, and again in 2002, when it was released on CD. Now, I cannot find the original 1956 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d LP for sale, but would love to add it to my collection. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a line on one, shoot me a message, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d greatly appreciate it.\n\nIn honor of Ramblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share some of our favorite songs, albums, performances, stories and tall tales about the legend himself. Drop those comments in the section below. We look forward to hearing from you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nStay safe, talk soon.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n-Dakota Silva\n(@silvadakota)\n\n#folkarchives #ramblinjackelliott",

I do not think promoting this behavior is a good idea because I can totally see it getting someone (or more likely a lot of bears) killed one day. \n\nI ultimately decided to use the virality of this video in an attempt to innoculate against future occurrences, in the hope that if presented with a choice like this, you'll choose the path that doesn't involve putting your body within striking distance of a momma bear with vulnerable cubs. Ever. \n\nSo first off, let me go ahead and state unequivocally that you should never ever ever approach any wild animal, especially those with offspring, unless all other options have been exhausted.\n\nOn the flip side, I also understand the impulse to save your pets. In this case, it worked out the best way possible (for the human at least) but she was soo damn lucky to get out of there in one piece. \n\nProtective instincts are on full display in this one, and I truly believe that the bear's fixation on the dogs allowed the woman to get close enough to tip the scales in her favor long enough to get the dogs and herself out of harms way.\n\nJust keep in mind that this could have ended very differently, so please don't try this.\n\n#natureismetal\n#keepnaturemetal \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nHit the link in our bio to browse our store! \n\nUse NIM10 at checkout!",
