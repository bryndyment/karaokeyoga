Japan gets an insane amount of snow so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not easy for snow records to fall. \n\nFollow @imlukesnow for my next Japan pow update coming this week. \n\nFor the first time in 53 years the snow depth exceeded 4 ft (1.2 m) in the city. \n\nBetween Friday night and Saturday morning, 19.7 in (50 cm) of snow fell in Niigata City, while Aikawa, in Sado City, recorded 15 in (38 cm). Both totals were the highest ever recorded in those locations. \n\nSnow also fell in areas that typically receive little snowfall, including Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Pacific side of the Tokai region. \n\nThis was a wild storm cycle and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so thankful to have been there for it.",

Today is Lerwick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Up Helly Aa, the largest of the festivals which mark the end of winter and are inspired by Shetland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Viking past, with communities across the islands coming together for a night of guizing, where traditional Shetland music is played and torches and a Viking longship are burned.\n\nShetland was once a Viking stronghold and the imprint they left still exists today. This is particularly the case in Unst, where there is the greatest concentration of evidence of the Vikings presence and subsequent Norse occupation. An archaeological project there, Viking Unst, has excavated three Viking longhouses and another, at Sandwick, was explored towards the end of the last century. There are more than 60 such sites on Unst.\n\nThroughout Shetland the names of places, geographical features, birds and parts of boats have Scandinavian roots, as do many personal names. The Shetland dialect is also infused with words that have their origins in Old Norse.\n\n#shetland #viking #scotland #history #fire #festival #vikings #ragnar #explore #reel #travel #folklore #beautifuldestinations #folkscenery #inspiration",

This powerful statement is a reminder that our lives are enriched by variety, inclusion, and unity.

Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choose fullness over emptiness.\n\nA simple message, but a crucial one: Without diversity, the shelves\u00e2\u0080\u0094and our lives\u00e2\u0080\u0094are empty. \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u008d\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00ac\n\nEdeka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impactful diversity campaign took place in August 2017. During this initiative, a Hamburg-based Edeka store removed all foreign-made products from its shelves, leaving them noticeably empty. This visual demonstration aimed to highlight the importance of diversity and how much we rely on international products in our daily lives. Signs placed on the empty shelves carried messages such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis shelf is pretty boring without diversity\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be poorer without diversity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d emphasizing the value of inclusivity and multiculturalism. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc\n\n#OhneVielfaltLeer #F\u00c3\u00bcrVielfalt #DiversityMatters #InclusionFirst #StrongerTogether #CelebrateDiversity #NoBorders #OpenHearts #GlobalUnity #OneWorldOneFamily #UnitedInDiversity #TogetherWeThrive #HumanityFirst #CulturalHarmony #DiversityIsStrength #BreakingBarriers #LoveBeyondBorders #TogetherForChange #WorldWithoutWalls #InclusionRevolution #EqualityForAll\n#OhneVielfaltLeer #F\u00c3\u00bcrVielfalt #DiversityMatters #InclusionFirst #StrongerTogether #CelebrateDiversity #NoBorders #OpenHearts #GlobalUnity #germany #india #usa",

Hence they often complain of dizziness on standing. \n\nSomeone on blood pressure lowering pills will suffer from this even more. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why many falls happen on standing, especially early hours of the morning when older people get up to go to toilet. \n\nThe simple tip - marching on the spot for 15-30 seconds- will help to pump blood back up to the brain and make moving much safer. \n\nAnother tip - keep hydrated and regularly review your medications: medications which helped you to survive into your 80s might start harming you now as side effects outweigh benefits in your 80-90s.",

Darren said it 'definitely tastes like good Japanese fried food'. The watermelon is marinated, pan fried, then dredged in flour, dipped in water-flour mixture, coated in panko then deep fried. Loved it with the negi miso sauce, sushi rice and shaved cabbage. Can you believe how much it looks like flesh?!! Texture wise it didn't feel like meat (not a bad thing) but was a really fun dish to make. Are you going to try? See all the steps in stories. #vegan",
