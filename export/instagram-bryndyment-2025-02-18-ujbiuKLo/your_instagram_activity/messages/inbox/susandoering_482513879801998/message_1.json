It features three bedrooms and two baths. Joseph Lucier and Stacey Caen represent the house for Sotheby's.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b8: David Duncan Livingston for Sotheby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s International Realty\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u009d: Liz Lindqwister \n\n#SFStandard #SanFrancisco #BayArea #RealEstate #SeaCliff #Presidio #AnselAdams",

Each of these has been cropped from a larger photo, some of which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared before and a few that are still to come. \n\nWhen I started this thing, back in 2018, it was just meant to be an outlet where I could offload some research that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done for a 1940s film project that was put on hold, and my bio at the time just said \u00e2\u0080\u009ca screenwriter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scratchpad about L.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since then, your constant enthusiasm and endless support has fueled my quest to learn everything I can about this city, and I have found myself diving down some pretty obscure rabbit holes, and digging up some pretty wild, unique, and, at times, utterly shocking stories that I will never forget. And you guys are always here, happy to come along for the ride, bringing further insights in your comments and messages, sharing memories and filling in the blanks, and I get to learn so much more.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for traveling with me through time. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nYour Ghost Guide:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 1. Taken at the Vogue Theatre & Market by G. Haven Bishop, April 1938.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 2. Ninth & Broadway, Christmas 1931 \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 3-4. Spectators observe a lunar eclipse at the Griffith Observatory, April 12, 1949\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 5. Vaudeville spectators at the Empress Theatre, taken by G. Haven Bishop in 1913\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 6. Looking east on 7th from Grand, December 4, 1941.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 7-8. Hot rod racing in the LA River, photographed by Allan Grant for LIFE in March of 1957.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 9. Early 1930s photo taken for SoCal Edison to document the lighting.

        "share_text": "I spent some time before my DJ gig tonight at the house of Josh Curtis, brother of the promoter, Cahn Curtis.  Josh is like a brother from another mother! \nOK, before I start\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Let me tell all you creeps: none of this stuff is for sale!  This is a carefully curated collection he has worked on for decades.  So keep that in mind when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading this post\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nothing is for sale! \nHe gave me the tour of his ranch, strewn about with old cars, World War II, jeeps, old barns, and all sorts of amazing things to look at.  One of the cars is a 1929 Chevrolet that was stolen by Clyde Barrow and used for three Iowa robberies by Bonnie and Clyde, before they abandoned it for another stolen vehicle. \nIn the back of the lot, a De Soto Suburban stretch wagon from the 1940s caught my eye.  These suckers are rare, and I was interested because Merle Travis used to tour in one of these with his band in the late 40s. Could this be Merle Travis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 old tour vehicle? Maybe it wound up out here in the Inland Empire?\nThen Josh took the inside his 1915 Sears and Roebuck kit home, which is preserved in a remarkable state of originality.  At that point, he started pulling out some real mind blowing stuff from his collection.\nJosh has collected all kinds of stuff and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I could have stayed there for a few days while he pulled stuff out. But we started with vintage clothing, and he has a crazy collection\u00e2\u0080\u00a6wow!\nI saw Mickey Cohen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robe,  Elvis Presley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s army shirt, a Gene Autry suit, a Bob Hope jacket, a Frank Sinatra jacket, a Spike Jones jacket, Tommy Dorsey shirt, a Johnny Cash shirt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a suit owned by Clyde Barrow of Bonnie and Clyde, and one of Buddy Holly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shirts! Too much amazing stuff!\nBefore long, I had to get to my gig.  Before I left, however, Josh gifted me a hubcap and a piece of the exhaust from a car he had bought and sold a few years ago: a Cadillac that Johnny Cash bought for June Carter in 1965. When he decided to sell the vehicle, He kept a hubcap and this piece of the exhaust\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And gave it to me! Does this mean I have to start my own \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne Piece at a Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d psychobilly Cadillac? \nThanks for the tour, Josh, my mind was blown!",

Then, your guide leads the way to a prime location perfect for watching a local fireworks show. \n\nHere is a review from one of our Sunset and Fireworks Tours: \n\nAs a relatively newcomer to kayaking, I felt very safe in the knowledge that we had three experienced guides with us during our paddle. They were focused on ensuring all of us were safe at all times, having a good time, as well as following lighting regulations for kayaks operating at night. I would recommend this paddle to anyone who wants to see the fireworks from the water's vantage point. It was awesome and very magical.\" - Trip Advisor. \u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0086 @attractions_victoria \n\n#nurturedbynature #pacificapaddle #brentwoodbayBC #Saanichton #Saanich #VictoriaBC #vancouverisland #SidneyBC #HelloBC #attractionsvictoria #victoria #kayaking #kayakrentals #safetyfirst #exploreVictoriaBC #ExploreVI #DiscoverVictoriaBC #customerservice #kayaktour #kayakrental",

        "share_text": "In 2002, the photographer Michael Jang dropped off a box of prints at San Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Museum of Modern Art. He had taken the pictures in the 1970s, and hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looked at them much since then. Only now, as his teenage children were in school and he was winding down his successful career as a family and editorial portrait photographer, had he begun to delve into the archive of negatives, contact prints and enlargements stored in his garage. At the time, the museum had a policy that any portfolio submitted by any artist would be reviewed by its curators. Jang wondered if they might be interested.\n\nMany of the photos were taken in the early 1970s, while Jang \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a shy Chinese-American boy from Marysville, a suburban town in northern California \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was studying at CalArts in Los Angeles. Majoring as a design student, on a whim Jang had taken an elective course in photography, a choice that turned out to be life-defining. \n\nPhoto 5.)

        "share_text": "A famed route on the smallest of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four main islands offers breathtaking views and an array of lessons on history, culture and generosity.\n\nThe pilgrimage on Shikoku is a 750-mile route that links 88 Buddhist temples, each of which claims a connection to Kukai, a celebrated monk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 posthumously known as Kobo Daishi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who, after returning from a trip to China in the ninth century, founded one of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan.\n\nAfter Kukai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in 835, wanderers began making pilgrimages to the sites on Shikoku that were affiliated with his life and work: his birth and burial places, the caves where he meditated, the sites of various religious rites. Later, these sites were linked, and the temples and shrines were formally numbered.\n\nAs is true with many modern-day pilgrimages, the ranks of Shikoku pilgrims \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once exclusively practitioners of Shingon Buddhism, one of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have grown to include travelers with a more diverse array of motivations. And so the steady succession of monks, priests and faithful Buddhists has given way to young people on journeys of self-discovery, older hikers enjoying their retirement and even foreign visitors who know little of the language and customs but are drawn by the adventure of the trek.\n\nTap the link in our bio to read more from @nytimestravel about the Shikoku Pilgrimage and advice for how to embark on the journey yourself.

Brooks felt this singing moment was ridiculous, but Gene thought it critical for Dr Frankenstein to be able to demonstrate how amazing the monster really was.\n\nBrooks later said: \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGene was dead right because it took the movie to another level\u00e2\u0080\u0094our level. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what audiences were paying for. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying for a true artistic resemblance to James Whale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies. They wanted to laugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGene understood an audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love of surprise don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think?\n.\n.\n.\n#youngfrankenstein #genewilder #melbrooks #frankenstein #maryshelley #hollywoodactors #movieblog #moviestowatch #moviecommunity #hollywoodlegend #hollywoodstars #classicfilm #classicfilms #musicalactor #cultfilm #puttingontheritz #comedymovies #comedygold #greatmovie #filmlovers #filmgeek #filmblog #oldhollywoodstars #willywonka #hollywoodfilms #brideoffrankenstein #jameswhale #filmhistory #oldhollywood",

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the lookout for vintage menus, postcards, matchbooks, signage, dining booths, displays, and more! On a more personal level \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for Angelenos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 family recipes, anecdotes, event invitations, personal photos of vintage LA dining experiences, anything and everything food-related that you can think of.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nPic 1: @grandcentralmarketla \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bustling as always \u00e2\u0080\u0093 back in 1987.

        "share_text": "The Legend of Hiney Wine\nJanuary 3, 20165  Bryan Dent\n\nWritten by Bryan Dent\nAs hoaxes go, so-called Hiney Wine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 advertised on radio stations all across America in the early 1980s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too hard to see through. Nevertheless, enough people got taken in that the gag took on a life of its own, even spawning a real-life Hiney Wine that still stalks the land to this day.\nHiney Wine was the brainchild of a radio DJ named Terry Dorsey, who in 1981 was the morning guy at struggling station KPLX in Dallas. Dorsey scripted a bogus commercial for a place called \u00e2\u0080\u009cHiney Winery\u00e2\u0080\u009d and aired it for laughs. The winery was supposedly founded by Uncle Harry Hiney, a homebrewer who was persuaded by his nephews Big Red Hiney and Thor Hiney (get it?) that \u00e2\u0080\u009chis Hiney was too good to keep to himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No butt-joke or bad pun was too lame to run: the entire Hiney clan formed a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrack inspection team\u00e2\u0080\u009d to ensure no Hiney Wine was sold before its time, and the Hiney Winery motto was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou only go around once in life, so grab all the Hiney you can get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe Hiney spots proved to be such a hit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and fooled enough listeners \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Dorsey and the general manager at the station, T. J. Donnelly, sold the scripts to radio stations around the country (Los Angeles DJ Rick Dees, of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisco Duck\u00e2\u0080\u009d fame, ran them for years). The ads were altered to give a different location for Hiney Winery depending on where they aired. Listeners in Virginia (for example) were told Hiney was headquartered on Butts Station Road in Chesapeake, Virginia; Vermonters were told it came from the small town of Hinesburg, Vermont. The location given was usually a real place, and residents of these obscure locales found themselves fending off visitors asking, innocently or not, where they could find Hiney.\nDorsey and Donnelly made even more money by selling Hiney paraphernalia: buttons, ballcaps, t-shirts and the like. They kept the hoax alive as long as possible, changing locations around and telling callers who complained they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find Hiney that the winery had burned down, but would be re-opening again shortly.\nEventually the gag ran its course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some would say none too soon.

After studying drawing and submitting work to Disney Studios while still an adolescent (he was considered for an in-house position), he enrolled in a commercial lettering school. Thereafter, he created advertising posters, worked at several Philadelphia portrait studios and sketched caricatures in Atlantic City. In 1947, he left for New York, where he became a photographer for Junior Bazaar. He soon met Robert Frank through the publication, and the two became friends and shared Mr. Frank's studio. He continued to photograph until 1984, when after being struck by a car, before he died in 2001. \n\nWith his blurred backdrops and tenderness towards his human subjects, Faurer was one of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most unashamedly poetic photographers. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy eyes search for people who are grateful for life, people who forgive and whose doubts have been removed, who understand the truth, whose enduring spirit is bathed by such piercing white light as to provide their present and future hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Louis Faurer \n\n#louisfaurer #louisfaurerphotographer #louisfaurerphotography #kodak #kodakvollenda #35mm #robertfrank #robertfrankphotography @robertfrankphoto #timessquare #newyorkphotography #nycphotography #nycstreetphotography #nycstreetphotographer #vintagestreetphotography #70snyc #disney #disneyartist #futurehope #chelseahotel @thechelseahotel #thechelseahotel @disneystudios @juniorbazaar07 #juniorbazaarmagazine #1940sphotography #1970sphotography #70snyc #40snyc #30snyc #combover #twins #thebasicwritingsofsigmundfreud #sigmondfreud @_sigmond_freud_ #freudianwoman",

        "share_text": "Some are happy to be carpenters, some are happy to be farmers and some are happy to be chefs. For decades, Haseyan has been happy to be a carpenter, a farmer and a chef all in one.\n\nIn 1982, Haseyan started \"Canadian farm\" in Hara village. He was 26 years old. For more than forty years, the man has built an organic farm, a restaurant, a gallery, a shop, a guesthouse, almost a village. All with his own hands, with his sense of creativity and with many reclaimed materials from his forest and land. Many of his buildings are unique in their form and structure. \"No form, no meaning\" says Haseyan.\n\nAt almost 70, Haseyan gets up at 5 am every day, goes to work on one of his construction sites, then goes to his farm to pick herbs, plant vegetables before opening the restaurant, preparing and serving meals with his employees. The restaurant offers dishes cooked on wood fires, with products from the farm, smoked meat, dried by Haseyan, bread made by Kumi-san at the restaurant and known for its quality.\n\nHaseyan showed us his examples of makistove cookers, designed to heat water, the ground, the air (because of a system of pipes under the fireplace), but also imagined to make bread, takoyaki or okonomiyakis, to cook fish or to steam.\n\nHe had created it with his own hands, like everything else, like all the huge buildings, like the benches and the children's games. Haseyan is also a child. He likes to play with shapes, to create. In his forest we found a building with a door handle made from one of his many chainsaws.\n\nHaseyan is an artist, a free spirit in his way of life as much as in his creations. \n\nWe spent a week at the Canadian farm during the golden week to help out. Every day is a good day because, whether it's on the farm, on the job site or in the restaurant, Haseyan is happy to do what he does, and to share it with those who are interested. For us, Haseyan is more than just an interest. He is a very good friend and a real source of inspiration.\n\n@waranihon\n@ir_is_qr\n@canadian.farm.japan\n#carpentry #art #carpenter #freestyle #lifestyle #restaurant #hara #wood #woodwork #selfbuild #diy #reuse #freespirit #artist #japan #nagano  #creative #artistoflife #guesthouse",

        "share_text": "On this date in 1978, Talking Heads landed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for or the first time with their debut single, \"Psycho Killer\". The song would peak at #92 (March 11th 1978).\n\nThe video here is the classic PSYCHO KILLER, as performed on The Old Grey Whistle Test, the embodiment of David Byrne's contradictory rock: a throbbing expanse of vehemence - a song about communication and disgust at having to listen to people constantly repeat themselves then retaliating by being terse and leaving.\n\n'I can't seem to face up to the facts / I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax / I can't sleep cause my bed's on fire / Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire / Psycho killer...'\n\nByrne wrote the song in 1973 at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he and drummer Chris Frantz had a band called The Artistics. When Byrne presented the song, he explained that he wanted a Japanese section in the bridge, but when he asked a girl who spoke the language to come up with some murderous words, she understandably freaked out. \n\nFrantz' girlfriend, Tina Weymouth, spoke French, so they had her write a French part for the bridge instead. She drew inspiration from the Norman Bates character in the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock thriller Psycho, which influenced the next verse:\n\nYou start a conversation you can't even finish it\nYou're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything\nWhen I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed\nSay something once, why say it again?\n\nByrne incorporated a French line into the chorus: \"Qu'est-ce que c'est?\" (meaning \"What is this?\") and followed it with a stuttering warning:\n\nFa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better\nRun, run, run, run, run, run, run away\n\nThe end result is one of the most famous songs about a psychopathic murderer, influenced by two touchstones of the genre: Alice Cooper and the movie Psycho.\n\nThe French section in the Bridge roughly translates to:\n\nWhat I did that night\nWhat she said that night\nRealizing my hopes\nI launch myself towards a glorious destiny\n\nThis reveals that the psycho killer is targeting a woman, just as Norman Bates did in Psycho.\n\nDavid Byrne and Chris Frantz played this a few times in 1974 with their band The Artistics.",

Ota is the third largest auction in the world after the two Dutch auctions and only 30% of the product here was imported. The auction sells about 500 million stems a year. Delighted to hear and see that the Japanese aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fond of dye or glitter\u00e2\u0080\u0094all natural flower preference. We all know about Japanese sweet peas, lilies, chrysanthemums  and lisianthus but looking like clover is a thing! Enjoy! #loveflowers #floriculture #otaauction #japaneseflowers",

Unfortunately he never really checked out how shabby the building really was.\nAccording to various anecdotes from Roman Kozak's \u00e2\u0080\u0098This Ain't No Disco: The Story of CBGB\u00e2\u0080\u0099(1988):\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c...It opened on a Tuesday night, Dec. 27, '77, with Talking Heads headlining, supported by the Shirts & the Tuff Darts. The next night it was the Dictators & the Dead Boys. Patti Smith headlined December 29, 30 & 31. There were problems right from the beginning...\n...[says] Bill Shumaker. \"It was in December, it was bitter cold, but the heating system never really worked. I never went down into the basement, but you could look down & it honestly looked like one of the rings in Dante's Inferno. And down there was the boiler. Everybody got serious colds...\n[Sound engineer] Norman Dunn: \"It was an exercise in how many things could go wrong. The boiler room was under eleven feet of water because the water mains broke. The generator outside was running the electricity for everything & it was driving the neighbors crazy...There were threats, the police were there;...\nJoel Webber is even more graphic: \"The place was disgusting. We were talking about 80 years' worth of dirt. I mean there was popcorn left over from the last performance of the Yiddish theater in 1925...\u00e2\u0080\u009d.After the Patti Smith dates, the Theater closed, briefly used as a rock'n\u00e2\u0080\u0099roll flea market, re-opening for shows with the Jam & the Tuff Darts on March 31st & #thecramps , the Erasers & the Sic F*cks on April 1st 1978. It is believed that by nid-\u00e2\u0080\u009978 the new enterprise had come to an end, costing Kristal a loss of about $160,000.",

        "share_text": "I love going to estate sales. Most of you know that about me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest with you, buying more \u00e2\u0080\u009cstuff\u00e2\u0080\u009d hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been my goal for a very long time. Yes, occasionally I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll buy a book, or a record, or some tools. The thing that truly piques my interest, however, is getting a glimpse into the past, behind closed doors that never would have been open otherwise.  Like walking through archaeological ruins, estate sales fascinate me. I see homes where people used to live and who obviously once cared a lot about their spaces.  Fancy serving plates. Sculpted back yard gardens. Garage workbenches. Sewing rooms. Through sickness, death, apathy, or any multitude of reasons, these places become neglected and eventually fall prey to the careless hands of the throngs of estate sale diggers and pickers.  This thought is never far from my mind when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m carefully cultivating the style of my house, arranging collectors items that mean a lot to me, or simply keeping a home filled with love and laughter and joie de vivre.  I know some day these same careless pickers will be digging through my stuff, making a huge mess, and eradicating the lovely place that I called home.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so fascinated watching this process happen to dead people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homes, but like a train wreck, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to look away. And of course, every now and then I will dig some impossibly rare treasure out of a pile of forgotten rubble, and I feel like maybe I have saved and preserved one tiny part of that person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy.  One thing is for sure, though, no matter how much \u00e2\u0080\u009cstuff\u00e2\u0080\u009d you accumulate, your time on this planet isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very long, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over before you know it.",

And exactly 84 years ago today on December 1, 1938 NYC Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia in an effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean up the streets\u00e2\u0080\u009d outlawed pushcarts and forced many immigrant peddlers to stop selling merchandise on the street and use their life savings to relocate their business indoors to a market (the Essex Street Market in the Lower East Side also opened on December 1, 1938). Immigrant peddlers who could not afford an indoor stand were simply out of luck. \nThankfully Joel Russ had the foresight to save his money and open his family-owned business @russanddaughters in 1914. The store is believed to be the first shop to have ever used the words \u00e2\u0080\u009c& Daughters\u00e2\u0080\u009d in its official name as businesses were usually passed from father to son. It is now co-owned by @nikirussfederman the great granddaughter of its founder. Russ & Daughters Appetizers also has one of our favorite #neon signs in all of NYC as it not only has gorgeous channel letters in two different colors but the store\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name is also flanked by two neon whitefish in a downward dog pose. Although the shop itself dates back to 1914, the #neonsign was installed in 1951 and was refurbished by @lettherebeneon in 2008. We absolutely love the signage and have also photographed it at night (swipe left for 2nd photo)\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nOur photo of Russ & Daughters is one of the many #momandpopshop of New York City which we will have on display at Village Works Gallery & Bookstore located at 90 East 3rd Street between 1st & 2nd Avenues. In partnership with @villageworksnyc we are currently having a PRINT SALE where 12x12 inch and 11x14 inch UNFRAMED prints are on sale for @ $119/print or $199 MOUNTED and FRAMED in a white contemporary 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d width frame. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n#storefrontcollective #momandpopshops",

        "share_text": "Fukaya. Saitama prefecture.\n\nIn Fukaya, it is possible to discover a rare site: a cinema in a old sake factory.\n\nSeveral decades ago, Takeishi, originally from Tokyo, moved to Fukaya, his wife's hometown. Passionate about cinema, the man discovered an old abandoned sake factory. There, a great project was born: to revive the place, by multiplying the activities there, the most important of which would be the opening of a real cinema. For this, Takeishi had to renovate the place. Optimistic and determined, he created an association and collected all the funds. The cinema was born in 2002.\n\nThe cinema building has retained its original charm.  Inside, visitors can discover a different programme from other cinemas, with many films rares, engaged, documentaries,  from many countries of the world but also classics. People can give their opinion about the movies to project. Takeishi also bought two old projectors and almost two hundred old reel-to-reel films in Tokyo. From time to time, the cinema offers the screening of an old film, a treasure to be preserved for the manager.\n\nInside the old sake factory, there are several valuable buildings. They are also rented out. Several activities accompany the cinema, such as a caf\u00c3\u00a9, a 2nd hand bookstore, local craft shops, and a hall hosts events such as dance performances and workshops.\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the cinema, the association is planning to buy the whole site to ensure its preservation. The site is threatened by a road project.\nBecause of its architectural character, charm, history and special features, the cinema regularly receives financial support from individuals and even actors and directors. Several years ago, the actress Kirin Kiki came to Fukaya and made a large donation, attracted by the project.\n\nThrough its action, the association wishes to revitalise a town affected by numerous abandoned houses and buildings.\n\nDo not hesitate to contact the cinema if you wish to support the project.\n\n@waranihon \n@ir_is_qr \n\n#cinema #saitama #fukaya #engaged #tradition #culture #japan #library #reuse #recycle #renovation #historical #architecture #sake #project #optimistic #charming #support",

Nothing much, apparently. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nInstead, merchants use the leaf as an attractive frame for the sweet coating, which is drier and crispier than the tempura surrounding, say, a shrimp. Some cooks also add sesame seeds for an extra pop of flavor. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nLocals refer to maples as momiji, which means \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecomes crimson-leaved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The word also translates literally to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but fret not\u00e2\u0080\u0094no babies were harmed in the making of this unusual treat. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nBaby maple leaves, on the other hand, are not so lucky. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nTap the link in bio to learn more. \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0081",

It is a famous tourist destination because of the personalities which have patronized it: Salvador Allende, the poet Pablo Neruda, the artist Josignacio and many others. La Bodeguita lays claim to being the birthplace of the Mojito cocktail, prepared in the bar since its opening in 1942, although this is disputed. The rooms are full of curious objects, frames, photos, as well as the walls covered by signatures of famous or unknown customers, recounting the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past. \u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b8 @cocktailbars",

I saw an odd thing on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoadsideAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u009d app, about a neon business in Minneapolis that had a collection of vintage sputnik neon signs.  I wondered around a large industrial building until I saw a nondescript black door with a tiny sign that said \u00e2\u0080\u009cskyline neon.\u00e2\u0080\u009c I knocked on the door, and a woman named Annie let me in. She was working on restoring a vintage neon sign, which I found totally fascinating, and she also turned on all the working neon in the place so I could take some pictures. Her partner, the owner of the place, Matt, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t around, but I applaud Matt and Annie for being hospitable to strangers knocking on their doors! This place is incredible! All the old ones you see are part of Matt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection, but they do restoration of old signs and even build new neon signs that look like old ones. What an amazing place!",

        "share_text": "In the heart of downtown Kyoto, mere steps from the old Imperial Palace, a narrow stone-paved alley runs through a pocket of historic homes. Only the occasional passerby from the subway station reminds us that this is in fact modern Kyoto, not the ancient capital of centuries past. It was in this space that Junko Uchiyama and Christopher Flechtner found their home. The couple, along with their eight-year-old son, Nikki, sought a place that could serve as a family dwelling as well as a creative base for their firm, @christopherflechtner, which operates under Chris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. The couple are prolific creators, designing innovative pieces from cargo bicycles to futuristic espresso machines, along with furniture and lighting for their new collaborative, @the_craftsmancollective. They looked at many properties, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut nothing had any soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Chris. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing felt inspiring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eventually, they set their sights on a 107-year-old machiya, a classic Kyoto townhouse. The intricacies of buying a home in Japan meant that a full inspection wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possible until after the deal was signed\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a closer look revealed several surprises. Along with a hauntingly large arachnid dried up in the sink\u00e2\u0080\u0094which inspired the home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpider Hollow\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wooden frame was a bit off kilter. Undeterred, Junko and Chris embarked on a renovation that embraced the home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quirks and put a playful spin on the classic style. And, in the process, they uncovered the perfect home for their family.

        "share_text": "Pasadena's \"Circle Cafe\" in 1946, looking like the kind of joint you'd see in a film noir where a decent kid could stop in with a wallet full of cash and wind up leaving with a bucket of problems. \n\nLocated at 953 East Colorado, the Circle Cafe seems to have opened at some point in 1943, as their liquor license was granted that October, but the cafe didn't really make headlines until 1945 when the owners decided to paint the place fuchsia, upsetting local residents and business owners so much that they started leaning on the city to shut the place down. \n\nWithin weeks, the city sent building inspectors who determined that the cafe's newly-pinkish walls protruded three inches over the sidewalk and thus needed to be stripped out. Circle Cafe's lawyers asked that the city simply \"wink at it\" until their lease was up, but given that they still had five years on it, the city took the request as a slap in the face and ordered them to face a \"police court jury trial.\" Two months later, Circle was looking to settle, having already removed the controversial color from its facade, and promising to move its back its metal walls. As this shot was taken that November, this exterior was likely the compromise. \n\nAfter that, things seemed to settle for the cafe, and they ran for at least another decade without issue, but they do pop up in another preposterous legal battle in 1956, when they went up against an archaic Federal tax law which stated that if anybody ever sings in a bar, customers included, then the establishment will automatically owe a 20% \"cabaret tax\" for \u00e2\u0080\u009cproviding entertainment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So if your friends drunkenly belt out an off-key verse of \"Happy Birthday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then the place is immediately deemed an entertainment venue, as \"singing is singing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \"whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being performed by professional entertainers or volunteer amateurs.\" \n\nThe Tavern Owners Association of California had Circle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back on that one and succeeded in overturning the law.\n\nFinally, just want to point out that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHot Men\u00e2\u0080\u009d sign on the far right actually reads \u00e2\u0080\u009cHotel Mentor\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nPhoto by J.

The Kii piece appeared in the May 3rd edition of The New York Times (A14). This was my first time having photos + essay in the print edition of a national / semi-global paper. \n\nI was all like: Ohh, no big deal, whatever, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in print, blah blah blah. But \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0you know what. IT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S KINDA COOL. Turns out: A lot of people read this thing in print. \n\nFeeling grateful for the attention. \n\nHuge thanks for all the kind emails and messages. Especially hearted by letters from folks writing *from* Kii \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and from folks who grew up on the peninsula, now living elsewhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with kind things to say, and stories of their own to share. Just hoping I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done justice as interloper to their amazing hunk of land given limited space. \n\nAs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said in newsletters, the book I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m currently working on is Kii focused, with a strong memoir element. I hope for that project to also elevate and shine a unique light on the peninsula. \n\nAlso also: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sold a crazy number of copies of \u00e2\u0080\u009cKissa by Kissa\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the last week, along with a bunch of SPECIAL PROJECTS memberships. So THANK YOU to everyone who felt inspired enough to buy a weird, expensive book about pizza toast (only ~200 copies left), and to become a member of an amorphous membership program with fuzzy deliverables. \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\nOK, back into the writing and photo editing mines.",

        "share_text": "This is a very special post: to celebrate 10k followers, here's the video I've been most wanting to post since 2021 - a full dance tutorial by David Byrne!\nI've spent so long searching/researching for this, but it gives me great pleasure to finally share it, it's genuinely a very fun dance routine to follow!\n\nThe video was recorded about a year ago, for SOCIAL!, a social distance dance club which David Byrne co-created during lockdown last year while away from American Utopia. It's quite a fascinating event that took place last April - anybody could sign up and attend an hour session of dancing, safely distanced from each other. For the final song, everybody was encouraged to dance in sync with the routine that you see in this video, provided in advance for attendees to learn.\n\nNOTE: this is not to be confused with the similar video recorded in the same room+outfit, featured in the \"Food for Love\" charity stream in February 2021. I was searching for that video before I found out about this one, although the best I could previously find was the 2 low quality minute-long clips posted by the TikTok user called byrnetok.\n\nNow that I've got info out of the way, time for some words about reaching 10k followers - wow! Never Thought this account would get so big. It's been quite time consuming, but very fun. I've loved interacting with all of you and seeing the enjoyment people have gotten from the daily clips of David in their feed. Now some thank yous:\nTo @dailydavidbyrnenoises - without his account, I wouldn't have had the idea to make mine!\nTo @csakjutka who helped me in my quest to find this\nTo everybody who's followed, interacted with, or sent suggestions to me\nAnd to David Byrne for being such an inspiration, as a dancer/musician/artist/person!\nCouldn't have done it without all of you \u00e2\u0099\u00a5\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\n.\n.\n\n#davidbyrne #talkingheads #americanutopia #dance #socialdistancedanceclub",

        "share_text": "Posted by @sfheritage \n\nCongratulations to Tia Margarita (@tiamargarita.sf), one of the newest businesses recommended to the Legacy Business Registry by SF's Historic Preservation Commission.\n\nLocated on the corner of Clement and 19th Avenue in the Richmond District, this third-generation, family-owned Mexican restaurant has operated continuously for the past 58 years. It was founded by Virginia and Alex Hobbs with business partners Myrtle and John Holbrook in 1963, replacing a neighborhood bar known as the Bostonian. Virginia and Alex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children, Penny Moreci and Helen Hobbs, joined the business in 1979, and their grandchild, Jennifer Corwin, came on board in 1997. Jennifer currently owns and operates the restaurant.\n\nFrom its earliest years, Tia Margarita has been a popular gathering spot serving northern Mexican cuisine and cocktails. The menu was developed by chef Alejandro Espinosa in the 1960s, and continues to feature the same classics that made Tia Margarita an instant success. Highlights include Chili con Queso, Gambas Al Ajillo, Chili Rellenos, and, of course, the fresh lime margaritas. Due to its welcoming atmosphere and neighborhood feel, the restaurant is frequently the site of social, political, and school meetings, and a popular venue for birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions.\n\nThe restaurant is also defined by its physical features, including a horseshoe shaped bar, neon marquee, Mexican-style stained glass windows, and Aztec masks, which were first displayed at the Golden Gate International Exhibition on Treasure Island (1939-1940). Tia Margarita is committed to maintaining these historic features and remaining an anchor tenant of the Richmond District, where friends and family can gather for years to come.",

        "share_text": "(Long story ahead) If you know me, you know that my emotions are often just barely below the surface. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much sometimes to get me choked up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten emotional talking about a sign or someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to a sign but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never just stopped at my work desk and had a decent little cry until today. This door is part of a larger piece I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tiny little lock near the door handle. That tiny little lock has a tiny dab of brass colored paint dead center. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what made me cry. Getting that paint in the right spot. That little speck. The reason it means so much is that 7-8 years ago my eyes started to fail. Both retinas tore within a month of each other. Both retinas then detached a few months apart later that year requiring emergency procedures to repair them. Multiple laser surgeries in each eye. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the fluid completely drained from each eye and had each eye filled with nitrogen gas twice (google \u00e2\u0080\u009cvitrectomy\u00e2\u0080\u009d if you dare). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had scar tissue peeled from my retinas and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had cataract surgery in each eye. As a result the vision in my left eye is scrambled dead center. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize a face with just my left eye. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that bad. This scrambled vision in my left eye leaves me with double vision and a complete lack of depth perception. I also can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see straight lines in my right eye because my retinas were worked over so much there is residual damage/scar tissue. I am extremely lucky to not be blind right now and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an exaggeration. I guess the reason I broke down and cried is because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone from a guy who was just trying to not go completely blind to a guy who can make things like this and who can sometimes get tiny little spots of paint exactly where they belong. Thanks for reading and thanks for all the support. You are all the absolute best. And if you ever start to see flashes or thousands of tiny little black dots floating around, get to the eye Dr ASAP. .#scalemodel #diorama #door #maker #artist",

        "share_text": "Azor Dutch bike. LARGE. \u00c2\u00a3180.\n\nNote: shop is still closed for repairs, but we can arrange a viewing for bike sales. Please ask if  you like any of the bikes posted.\n\nBeautiful Azor traditional Dutch bike. We got this bike given by a neighbour, it was sitting in a garden for very long time (check condition in last picture!). It took us so much time and effort to fix, the seatpost was seized, we had to rebuilt the front wheel, derust and repaint frame.... but it is alive again and ready for a new life. \n\nAzor bikes are real Dutch machines, made in Holland (yes the real deal!) and known for being so sturdy and reliable. Not as famous as Gazelle or Batavus perhaps (they don't spend big money in marketing), but Dutch bike connoisseurs will know that they are at the top when it comes to quality.\n\nIt is a traditional omafiets, with a very elegant geometry, super relaxed cycling position that keeps your back totally straight, and really reliable components. Gears are internal Sachs Torpedo, 3 speed, and brakes are both internal too (drum brake on front, coaster brake rear). This is perfect for the winter (the Dutch know!) as drivetrain and braking performance is not affected by adverse weather, unlike the majority of bikes (that use external setups).\n\nObviously this an utility bike so really practical: it comes with chainguard, mudguards, bell, kickstand, and rear pannier rack. \n\nWe have repainted it with durable Hammerite anti rust paint, new set of decals and a full service, including new bearings in headset, bottom bracket replaced, new cables, new saddle, and a new set of Schwalbe tyres with puncture protection.\nIt rides very well, smooth and super comfortable.\n\nOverall, if you are a tall person (over 5 8, 1.75m) and want a stylish, solid, comfortable, low maintenance and practical bike, this could be your ideal wheeled friend.",

It was surprisingly difficult to close and open them, because if we fit them perfectly, they wouldn't open, and if they were too loose, drafts would come in. However, I believe that a house is a space where the inside and outside can interact through the openings rather than a space enclosed by walls, so the work was repeated in details in order to bring nature in while securing a relaxing atmosphere. Even though there are gaps, just think \"there is a crack in everything, so light can enter\" .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#japan #waranihon #mobilehouse #diy #housedesign #tinyhouse #sustainable #ecovillage #simplelife #documentary #handmade #nature #\u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e3\u0080\u0080#\u00e3\u0082\u008f\u00e3\u0082\u0089\u00e3\u0081\u00ab\u00e3\u0081\u00bb\u00e3\u0082\u0093 #\u00e3\u0083\u00a2\u00e3\u0083\u0090\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0083\u00ab\u00e3\u0083\u008f\u00e3\u0082\u00a6\u00e3\u0082\u00b9\u00e3\u0080\u0080#\u00e3\u0082\u00bf\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0083\u008b\u00e3\u0083\u00bc\u00e3\u0083\u008f\u00e3\u0082\u00a6\u00e3\u0082\u00b9 #\u00e5\u00b0\u008f\u00e5\u00b1\u008b\u00e4\u00bd\u009c\u00e3\u0082\u008a #\u00e3\u0082\u00b7\u00e3\u0083\u00b3\u00e3\u0083\u0097\u00e3\u0083\u00ab\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e6\u009a\u00ae\u00e3\u0082\u0089\u00e3\u0081\u0097 #\u00e8\u0087\u00aa\u00e7\u0084\u00b6\u00e3\u0080\u0080#\u00e6\u0089\u008b\u00e4\u00bd\u009c\u00e3\u0082\u008a\u00e3\u0080\u0080#\u00e3\u0082\u00a8\u00e3\u0082\u00b3\u00e3\u0083\u0093\u00e3\u0083\u00ac\u00e3\u0083\u0083\u00e3\u0082\u00b8",

        "share_text": "HORROR NOIR: The Peter Lorre film STRANGER ON THE THIRD FLOOR (1940) is often referenced as one of the first true noirs. The film can be seen as connective tissue: it is heavily influenced by German Expressionism (the dream sequence looks like an abstract theater set, sparse & horizontal) while released at the very beginning of the classic Hollywood noir cycle. When a cafe owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat is cut, a reporter (John McGuire) becomes both witness & suspect, flagging attention to the odd-looking suspicious neighbor upstairs (Lorre); the reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fianc\u00c3\u00a9e (Margaret Tallichet, aka William Wyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife from 1938-1981) sets to prove his innocence by encountering the mysterious recluse. One of the few films directed by Latvian immigrant Boris Ingster, who mostly worked in television; written by Hungarian immigrant Frank Partos, though contemporary research proves that this was finished by an uncredited Nathanael West. Look out for Elisha Cook Jr. as a cab driver. The film occasionally feels like a 1920s German horror film: disorienting silhouettes, sharp angles, heavy shadows, & low camera POV. The stylized set design & bent cityscapes came from art director Van Nest Polglase (1933\u00e2\u0080\u0099s KING KONG, 1941\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CITIZEN KANE). Shot by usual RKO cinematographer, noir godfather Nicholas Musuraca, with music by Roy Webb (reusing tunes here in 1944\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MURDER, MY SWEET). Influential to noir with its voiceover & cynicism towards authority i.e. molding \u00e2\u0080\u009cone human vs. the system\u00e2\u0080\u009d narratives. Shot while Lorre owed RKO two days on his contract which is why he is barely in the film, often seen barreling up stairs into darkness with a white scarf. Lorre is menacing & fantastic here, the perfect representation of horror + noir since he appeared in staple films of each genre (from 1931\u00e2\u0080\u0099s M to 1941\u00e2\u0080\u0099s THE MALTESE FALCON). The film was unfortunately not a box office success. To anyone that has ever had a creepy neighbor, this is for you. \n.\n#peterlorre #horror #noir #strangeronthethirdfloor #oldhollywood",

The theater name \u00e2\u0080\u009cKoma\u00e2\u0080\u009d was compared because the circular stage resembles a spinning top. In April 2015, the Shinjuku Toho Building, a composite composite of cinema multiplex tables, was built at the end of the Shinjuku Te Theater Toho Kaikan.

We will donate $20 from each membership to San Francisco legacy businesses. \n\nThe pins are a great way to show your love for the bars and restaurants that make San Francisco special while supporting Heritage's advocacy work - and they make great gifts! Please allow 2-3 weeks for shipping as we wait for our pin shipments to arrive.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00bb www.sfheritage.org/join ( **linkinbio**)\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b7 Watering holes: Trad'r Sam (Outer Richmond, Li-Po Lounge (Chinatown), The HA-RA Club (Tenderloin)\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b7 Eateries: Alioto's (Fisherman's Wharf), Sam Wo Restaurant (Chinatown), Tommy's Joynt (Van Ness corridor)",

I do not think promoting this behavior is a good idea because I can totally see it getting someone (or more likely a lot of bears) killed one day. \n\nI ultimately decided to use the virality of this video in an attempt to innoculate against future occurrences, in the hope that if presented with a choice like this, you'll choose the path that doesn't involve putting your body within striking distance of a momma bear with vulnerable cubs. Ever. \n\nSo first off, let me go ahead and state unequivocally that you should never ever ever approach any wild animal, especially those with offspring, unless all other options have been exhausted.\n\nOn the flip side, I also understand the impulse to save your pets. In this case, it worked out the best way possible (for the human at least) but she was soo damn lucky to get out of there in one piece. \n\nProtective instincts are on full display in this one, and I truly believe that the bear's fixation on the dogs allowed the woman to get close enough to tip the scales in her favor long enough to get the dogs and herself out of harms way.\n\nJust keep in mind that this could have ended very differently, so please don't try this.\n\n#natureismetal\n#keepnaturemetal \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nHit the link in our bio to browse our store! \n\nUse NIM10 at checkout!",

Her most important literary achievement was the epic Pax Britannica (1973-78), a trilogy about the rise and fall of the British Empire. She first came to public attention in 1953 as James Morris, the reporter who climbed 20,000 feet up Everest and broke the news that a British Expedition had conquered the mountain. In 1972, Morris underwent gender reassignment surgery, having realised from an early age that \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had been born in the wrong body, and should really be a girl'. Taking the name Jan, she wrote Conundrum (1974) describing her experiences.\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nIn this portrait by Arturo Di Stefano, Morris played an important part in the painting's development and entered into the process with great gusto. The landscape beyond the studio window includes references to Wales, Venice, Trieste, Manhattan, and Everest, all significant places in Morris's personal history and the inclusion of her Norwegian cat Ibsen, was non-negotiable. Morris described sitting for the portrait as 'life enhancing' and 'one of the happiest experiences of my life'.\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00f0\u009f\u008e\u00a8  Jan Morris by Arturo Di Stefano, 2004-2005, \u00c2\u00a9 National Portrait Gallery\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n#NationalPortraitGallery #portraiture #pride #NPGLondon\u00e2\u0081\u00a0 #pridemonth #lgbtq",

It had me at \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble doors & windows\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the rest of the house is pretty phenomenal too, including a stunning marble fireplace, an adorable kitchen with some original appliances, an amazing teal master bath (with that hardware I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even), and a gorgeously manicured backyard, just to name a few. The listing mentions that many parties were hosted here, and now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just sitting here crying thinking about the people that lived here and the fun times they had, and how life is fleeting, and how my old prison pal Red used to say you can either get busy living or get busy dying. Can someone buy this house and build a happy life here and throw fun parties so I can stop crying please? Thank you.

I know that I used to see a few for sale as posters at souvenir shops when I would visit the city as a kid. I just had no idea that they were all taken by the same photographer until I started in on these recent Ralph Crane appreciation posts and now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty happy to revisit these as a set. \n\nPhotos: \n1-2: Hollywood from Highland, looking east, 1951.\n3. Hollywood from Whitley, looking west, 1951.\n4. Mayor Norris Paulson reviews some notes as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driven along Hollywood in 1959.\n5. Wshire, looking west in 1959.

        "share_text": "Back in the mid-seventies, probably 1976, my mom and dad and I went on a long RV camping trip with my grandparents and my cousin. I think of this trip with so much fondness. \n\nI remember Dana getting gum stuck in her hair. About to the scalp. I remember us climbing on a big log that had fallen across a river and having no fear of falling as I walked across it. I remember lakes and rivers and mountains and trees. I remember treacherous mountain roads. I remember campfires and throwing anything I could into the flames. I remember getting in trouble for that. \n\nI remember the twangings of Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette and George Jones and Tanya Tucker and Charlie Rich and Glenn Campbell and, and, and...I remember an ashtray in the shape of a Goodyear tire which makes sense because my grandparents were in the trucking biz. It was Shoop Bros at that time...before they bought the place and it became Nick and Dee's Trucking...which last time I checked still exists.\n\nI remember cigarettes. So many cigarettes. I remember the leather cigarette case, always in my grandma's possession. I remember singing \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz\" over and over again to make Grandma Dee laugh. And she did every time. She was a great audience and obviously very patient. I remember my mother begging me to give it a rest.\n\nI remember my grandpa driving their new Winnebago with the orange stripes. I remember my grandpa liked to fish with cheese on a hook. I remember my mom finding a giant mushroom as big as my head. I remember fishing with my dad and I remember being good at casting my rod. I remember a bee wouldn't leave me alone. Probably due to the aroma of my grandpa's fishing cheese. I remember throwing that rod down and running away.\n\nI remember sleeping in the cabinet of our RV which became a bed at night and I remember thinking that was the neatest thing there was. I remember laying in the top bed over the driver's seat watching below as we blazed down the roads getting to our next destination.\n\nI miss Grandma Dee and Grandpa Nick. And though the memories have me misty, I think mostly of how lucky I am to have had these times together.\n\n~shared by @tchickphoto #savefamilyphotos",

He bought an old factory and built a wonderful and inspiring open space for everyone with recycling materials. He created compost toilets, kitchen/cafe, rooms, library, music and theater space, bath, garden.... In this space, several times per months, there are different workshops. Last week, people learnt how to make natto. Another time, people learnt how to make basket bamboo. At one kilometer, there are several mobile houses surrounded by forest, river, garden, sauna, compost toilet. There, the Bochi Bochi community was born with Naru, for people who want to create their own mobile house and share this lifestyle. In Yuru Yuru Haizai ecovillage, you feel in another world : a world where you can live relaxly, where you can live slowly, where people smiling, where people singing, where you are connected to nature, where the small troubles and the unnecessary things  disappear, where you can breathe fresh air, where you can hear birds singing, where you want to take action, where you want to be creative, where life becomes so simple and easy, where you want to share positive vibes. \nThanks to Hiryu, Naru and all the beautiful souls passing there ! \n\n@haizaiecovillage \n@tabisurumangaka\n@shishidon39 \n@nariakiakai \n@ir_is_qr\n\n#ecovillage #japan #fujino #lifestyle #free #freespirit #art #diy #recycle #reuse #reduce #ecology #respect #lifeisgood #artist #mobilehouse #compost #workshop #openminded #positive #creative #artistoflife #openspace #wonderful #nature #garden #compost #protect #realjapan #bochibochi #yuruyuru",

        "share_text": "Probably my most unusual and enchanting experiences - to photograph fireflies in Japan. Hotaru (\"fireflies\" in Japan) season lasts starting from May to around July in different regions of Japan. I've chosen Kyushu island with it's beautiful nature as my destination. \nOn these images you can see hime-botaru light dots. These are synchronous fireflies. Genji fireflies are other types of fireflies which leave the long trail as their light dims slowly. \n\nFireflies are very sensitive to ecological conditions. Unfortunately, they are not the best in the last few years, so it's starting to be very challenging to find fireflies. Sometimes it's just two or three days when they light up. And you can find this information only among local photographers. \n I came to each location early, long before 8-9 p.m. when first fireflies start to show up. Found best composition, setup my cameras and started to watch. First just a few fireflies start to blink slowly lifting up from the leaf. \nI felt like a kid looking for the first time in my life at a Christmas tree! It was so exciting and enchanting, like magic. At a certain moment, the fireflies synchronize and start blinking synchronously. Yellow-green flashes light up the forest with dim light, and for a few milliseconds you can see mysterious shrines and the dreamy bamboo forest. It was like a meditation. In deep dark space you are surrounded by soft emerald light for just a few seconds!\nI like watching anime and especially I am a big fan of  Hayao Miyazaki. His anime movies are always very kind and philosophical, inspired me for this project. \nI used 2 cameras and 2 bodies. Basically out of one day there are just 2 images in case you have 2 cameras!\nI used Nikon Z 7 + 58 mm 1.4 nikkor and Nikon D850 + 24-70 Nikkkor 2.8\nIt is essential to have wide open aperture lens!\nYou can't simply leave your camera for exposure more than 5 min. You'll have lots of hot pixels. So each photo consists of 100-120 exposures 20-25 s each merged in one long exposure using StarStax software. Like we do for startrails. Eventually you see this \"map\" of fireflies. But not a single photo can express that feeling when you see fireflies by your own eyes.",

Asakusa is a working class neighbourhood known for its major festivals. During the 1970s it was also a major entertainment district. Tsuchida writes: \"It was shortly after I started my life in the big city, and I was trying to escape my identity as a country bumpkin, and putting on an expressionless, imperturbable persona. However, I realised that this town had an eye that coldly saw through that.\"\n\nTakeover by @j_pulliam_photo\n#hiromitsuchida #japanesephotography",

The lights are concentrated around three of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities: Tokyo (top cluster), Nagoya (middle), and Osaka (bottom).\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\nFrom their orbiting home, astronauts have a view unlike anything most of us will ever see! In the past 20 years, they have shot millions of photographs, and it is not just a hobby. It is an important scientific job, and one they need to be trained to do. For example, researchers have used nighttime imagery of lights to better understand human activity. The images can reveal population changes, urban development, energy use, economic activities, and changes in types of lighting. \u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\nCredit: NASA \u00e2\u0081\u00a3\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a3\n#NASA #EarthViews #EarthPics #JapanPhotography #Glowing",

They pioneered the trend towards unusual and unique flavors (e.g. Secret Breakfast, a bourbon and cornflake flavor), and they were the ones to introduce me to this amazing idea. I first ate their ice cream around 10 years ago and have been enjoying it since.\n\nThe Honey Bear flavor, as you might guess, is a honey ice cream made with raw, wild Oregon honey. It will be available for the entire month of March or while supplies last.\n\n#fnnch #HumphrySlocombe #lickthat",

He later became a minister and preached until his eyesight failed ;and he began to cut and paint tin.  Miller had a number of repetitions in his work.  His neighbor Oscar would blow his horn as he drove by; and RA took that as a sign to make many BLOW OSCAR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.

My earliest pieces were painted on wood from Home Depot. I started with $12 / sheet Tri-PLY, which was gloriously inexpensive but warped easily, so I quickly switched to $24 / sheet B4 birch with an MDF core. It was affordable, had great color, and the MDF core made it dimensionally stable, but the quality varied tremendously (the \"B\" of \"B4\" means the front is second tier and the back fourth tier), and I eventually became frustrated with the many black streaks in the veneer. That's when I decided to tour MacBeath Hardwoods, a specialty lumber yard that stocks dozens of different plywoods, including many of \"A\" grade. Their wood is expensive, and the staff has little patience for newbies, but the quality is superior. I used $65 / sheet A2 white ash until they discontinued it, and then settled on $78 / sheet A1 hard maple, which I have been using since. \n\nBut on that very first visit I saw the $166 / sheet bamboo. It's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 cool. Not only is bamboo more sustainable than traditional plywood, but it has a distinctive pattern and texture. I knew I wanted to work with it, but back then I couldn't justify the cost, so I filed away the idea. This year I wanted to remix the Classic Bear in some new and distinctive way, and so I finally decided to work with bamboo plywood. \n\nBamboo Bear is 8.5\" x 22\", spray paint on cut bamboo plywood, signed and numbered from a limited edition of 100, and ready to hang with a picture hanging velcro that won't damage your walls. I am asking $1000 for them. They will ship within 14 days.\n\n#fnnch",

Most believe it translates best to \u00e2\u0080\u009csleeping excrescence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the fungus grows around the kernels and impedes their growth, thus leaving them to \u00e2\u0080\u009csleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nIn Mexican cuisine, and an infected cob is worth significantly more than a regular one.

Having grown up in Jackson, TN, the birthplace of Rockabilly, he felt a deep urge to capture them on film. But coordinating any type of photo shoot turned out to be impossible: they have no online presence and no formal contact info. So with only vague knowledge of where and when they meet, Renshaw packed his bags and flew to Tokyo. These portraits were captured over 5 weeks in 2013 and 2015, shooting at parks, parties, bars and music venues.\n\nThe Roller-zoku grew out of both 50s and 60s rock \u00e2\u0080\u0098n roll but also rockabilly because Japanese record labels at the time didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t differentiate between the two, explains Renshaw. But it was the revival in the lat 70s that brought to life what we know as Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Roller-Zoku. The groups are made up of both young and old, male and female. Their greased up pompadours and theatrical dancing can still be seen in Yoyogi Park on weekends. #dennyrenshaw",

Just before dawn on Jan. 31 a lunar trifecta \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Super Blue Blood Moon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will be visible in the sky. This full moon is the third in a series of \u00e2\u0080\u009csupermoons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is when the full Moon is at or near its closest point to Earth in its orbit. \nIt will also be the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblue moon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The super blue moon will pass through Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow to give viewers in the right location a total lunar eclipse. While the Moon is in the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow it will take on a reddish tint, known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblood moon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Make sure you get outside to experience this lunar event for yourself! Weather permitting, the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii will have a spectacular view of totality from start to finish (swipe to see the map). Unfortunately, eclipse viewing will be more challenging in the Eastern time zone. The eclipse begins at 5:51 AM ET, as the Moon is about to set in the western sky, and the sky is getting lighter in the east. \nCredit: NASA \n#nasa #space #moon #supermoon #eclipse #lunareclipse #superbluebloodmoon #earth #sun #trifecta #sky #astronomy #solarsystem #orbit #bloodmoon #january",
