I am the 4th owner of this van and everyone has kept the engine in great condition. I just did the brake pads, callipers, distributer cap, spark plugs, air filter, master cylinder, windshield wipers and wiper motor. Always keeping fluids changed and regulated. With only 95,000km. Has a decent amount of storage space. Tires are new with only a few hundred km on them. Has some rust on the bottom sides a bit. Have a receipt book of maintenance dating back to the late 70s. This my baby ,\u00f0\u009f\u0096\u00a4 please don't message me asking if it's still available.... I'll remove the add when it's not. Thanks\n\nPlease call or message with any questions.
