But so good that he gets to be with you all in Japan for an extended stay. My mom and aunt spent quite a lot of time at our home when our kids were younger as Al would be off traveling the world and I would be on my own juggling work and the kids. So they each babied the kids in so many ways. We sent Pablo off to college knowing that he was very capable academically, socially, and in his sports, but could he really do a load of laundry or prepare anything other than breakfast for himself?? We quickly learned that he could not ;-) So there were texts and calls to get guidance that he was too embarrassed to ask his peers for. Now that he is in a house with a group of guys, he has figured out that they are all very accomplished (changing their own oil, assembling IKEA furniture, cooking up a storm). So he is learning from them. It has been really positive. he arrives tomorrow and I am hoping he can help his sister prepare for finals as it is a literal crap show around here ;-) Al and I were up late trying to help her to organize study notes and submit past due assignments. We are too old for this bullshit ;-) But we also want her to get into a college (any college!) and get out of our house :-)",

Has always been so dedicated to his studies and his sports. But they have each been this way from birth and I realize our influence is limited ;-) Al and I support and encourage them but mostly step aside as they have such strong ideas.
