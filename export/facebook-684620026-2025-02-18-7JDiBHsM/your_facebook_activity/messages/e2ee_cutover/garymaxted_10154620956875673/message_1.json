I have only spent 2 or 3 days there over the years but everything I hear lately is how it has become an exciting, youthful, cosmopolitan place that is attracting creative people from all over the world.  Certainly it has its problems but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you have researched living there so I there is no need to go into that.
