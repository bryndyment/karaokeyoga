(\"Set up the printer.\" vs. \"Nice computer setup you have there.\", for example.) Often the adjective form is hyphenated: \"Did you follow the set-up instructions?\" I never learned this in school but I notice that lots of native speakers are unaware of this pattern and are constantly using the noun form as a verb. Drives me crazy but I have learned to keep quiet (except for here, now!).",
